# LLM Analysis Quiz
## Overview

This project was developed for the TDS (Tools in Data Science) course project, where the objective is to build an application that can autonomously solve multi-step quiz tasks involving:

- **Data sourcing**: Scraping websites, calling APIs, downloading files
- **Data preparation**: Cleaning text, PDFs, and various data formats
- **Data analysis**: Filtering, aggregating, statistical analysis, ML models
- **Data visualization**: Generating charts, narratives, and presentations

The system receives quiz URLs via a REST API, navigates through multiple quiz pages, solves each task using LLM-powered reasoning and specialized tools, and submits answers back to the evaluation server.
